# Launch a mysql container as a background task. It should be able to restart
# on its own in case of error, and the root password of the database should be
# Kerrigan. You will also make sure that the database is stored in the hatchery
# volume, that the container directly creates a database named zerglings, and
# that the container itself is named spawning-pool.

docker run -d --name spawning-pool -e MYSQL_DATABASE=zerglings \
-e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=Kerrigan -v hatchery:/var/lib/mysql --restart on-failure mysql

# You can inspect the container with command:
# docker container inspect spawning-pool
